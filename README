Maach Maze is an android game. It makes use of accelerometer sensor to control the main character
in this game which is a fish - maach means fish in bengali.

Your aim is to help reach this fish to its mother through different levels of mazes . But in the way
there are dangers in form of bigger fishes and sharks. You have to avoid them, else they bite you up
and it is game over. Also you can eat smaller fish and grow bigger to some extent.

The more fish you eat the more stars you complete the level with. The player has most fun avoiding
the larger fishes and sharks as they chase you by calculating the proximity. Also the smaller fish try
to avoid you and swim away.

There are currently 10 levels with increasing complexity of maze and more dangers. This game can
be run in openGL mode and also the canvas mode. In the openGL mode the water has been given
special rippling effect through the fragment shader.

You can also use touch mode to move the fish but its most fun when played with the accelerometer.
Also the accelerometer can be calibrated to adjust the sensitivity and base tilt angle.
